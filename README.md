# How this app works

> While working, there will be a very bright colors being blasted in your face to keep you awake and working
> While in break mode, there will be cool and calm colors to help you relax. :)

## Input a timer(minutes and seconds) for the work and the break, if left blank, then the work timer will default to 25:30 and the break timer will default to 05:00

## When the timer reaches 00:00, the device will vibrate for 1 second then it will switch to the other task

## Pressing 'START' will start the timer and pressing 'STOP' will stop/pause the timer

## When the reset button is clicked, the default values for the work timer(25:30) and the break timer(05:00) will be automatically set and the pomodoro timer will be in work mode.

## Changing the work timer while the work mode is running will stop the timer.

## Changing the break timer while the work mode is running will stop the timer.

## Changing the break timer while the break mode is running will reset the timer back to work mode with the default work time set so that break time would be used for next time.

## When both the work timer and the break timer have reached 0, the default time will be used instead.
